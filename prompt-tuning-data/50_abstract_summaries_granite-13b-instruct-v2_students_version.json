{"input": "The literature on the content and stability of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) in \ncitrus juices in relation to industrial practices is reviewed. The role of \nvitamin C from citrus juices in human diet is also reviewed. Citrus fruits and \njuices are rich in several types of bioactive compounds. Their antioxidant \nactivity and related benefits derive not only from vitamin C but also from other \nphytochemicals, mainly flavonoids. During juice processing, temperature and \noxygen are the main factors responsible for vitamin C losses. Non-thermal \nprocessed juices retain higher levels of vitamin C, but economic factors \napparently delay the use of such methods in the citrus industry. Regarding \npacking material, vitamin C in fruit juice is quite stable when stored in metal \nor glass containers, whereas juice stored in plastic bottles has a much shorter \nshelf-life. The limiting step for vitamin C absorption in humans is \ntranscellular active transport across the intestinal wall where AA may be \noxidized to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), which is easily transported across the \ncell membrane and immediately reduced back to AA by two major pathways. AA \nbioavailability in the presence of flavonoids has yielded controversial results. \nWhereas flavonoids seem to inhibit intestinal absorption of AA, some studies \nhave shown that AA in citrus extract was more available than synthetic ascorbic \nacid alone. DHAA is reported to possess equivalent biological activity to AA, so \nrecent studies often consider the vitamin C activity in the diet as the sum of \nAA plus DHAA. However, this claimed equivalence should be carefully reexamined. \nHumans are one of the few species lacking the enzyme (L-gulonolactone oxidase, \nGLO) to convert glucose to vitamin C. It has been suggested that this is due to \na mutation that provided a survival advantage to early primates, since GLO \nproduces toxic H2O2. Furthermore, the high concentration of AA (and DHAA) in \nneural tissues could have been the key factor that caused primates (vertebrates \nwith relative big brain) to lose the capacity to synthesize vitamin C. Oxidative \ndamage has many pathological implications in human health, and AA may play a \ncentral role in maintaining the metabolic antioxidant response. The abundance of \ncitrus juices in the Mediterranean diet may provide the main dietary source for \nnatural vitamin C.", "output": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a vital nutrient found in citrus fruits and juices, which are rich in bioactive compounds, including flavonoids."},

This study depicts some of the antioxidant interactions \nbetween citrus fruit carotenoids and ascorbic acid in models of animal cell \nmembranes and reinforces the contribution of them in promoting health benefits \nfor humans.", "output": ""},
{"input": "The citrus juice industry produces a large amount of fiber-rich waste and other \nbioactive compounds of great interest for their potential health benefits. This \nstudy focuses on the valorization of the co-product resulting from the \nextraction of orange juice to offer it as a versatile, healthy, high-quality, \nand stable natural food ingredient in powder form. To this end, the vitamin C \n(VC) content (ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid, AA and DHAA), major flavonoids \n(hesperidin and narirutin, HES and NAT), and techno-functional properties (angle \nof repose, AoR; hygroscopicity and wettability; density and porosity; mean \nparticle size, MPS; water retention capacity, WRC; oil holding capacity, ORC; \nemulsifying and foaming capacity, EC and FC; and emulsion and foam stability, ES \nand FS) have been characterized. In addition, considering that dehydrated foods \nwith high sugar content require the incorporation of high molecular weight \nbiopolymers for their physical stabilization, the influence of starch modified \nwith octenyl succinic acid (OSA) and gum Arabic (GA) on these properties has \nbeen studied. The results obtained confirm the high quality of this co-product \nto be offered as a powdered food ingredient with nutraceutical potential. The \naddition of the studied biopolymers is recommended as it does not modify the \nflowability of the powder and favors both the encapsulation of the bioactive \ncompounds, especially in the presence of GA, and the rehydration capacity.", "output": ""},
{"input": "Excessive accumulation of fat as the result of more energy intake and less \nenergy expenditure is known as obesity. Lipids are essential components in the \nhuman body and are vital for maintaining homeostasis and physiological as well \nas cellular metabolism. Fatty acid synthesis and catabolism (by fatty acid \noxidation) are normal part of basic fuel metabolism in animals. Fatty acids are \ndegraded in the mitochondria by a biochemical process called \u03b2-oxidation in \nwhich two-carbon fragments are produced in each cycle. The increase in fatty \nacid \u03b2-oxidation is negatively correlated with body mass index. Although healthy \nlife style, avoiding Western diet, dieting and strenuous exercise are the \ncommonly used methods to lose weight, they are not considered a permanent \nsolution in addition to risk attenuation of basal metabolic rate (BMR). \nPharmacotherapy offers benefits of weight loss by altering the satiety and \nlowering absorption of fat from the food; however, its side effects may outweigh \nthe benefits of weight loss. Alternatively, dietary phytochemicals and natural \nhealth products offer great potential as an efficient weight loss strategy by \nmodulating lipid metabolism and/or increasing BMR and thermogenesis. \nSpecifically, polyphenols such as citrus flavonoids, green tea epigallocatechin \ngallate, resveratrol, capsaicin and curcumin, have been reported to increase \nlipolysis and induce fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation through modulation of hormone \nsensitive lipase, acetyl-coA carboxylase, carnitine acyl transferase and \nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1. In this review \narticle, we discuss selected phytochemicals in relation to their integrated \nfunctionalities and specific mechanisms for weight loss.", "output": ""},
{"input": "The peel of Citrus reticulate 'Chachiennsis' (Chachi) is a well-known functional \nfood with multiple health benefits in Asia. There is an old saying \"the longer \ntime Chachi is stored, the better health benefits it has\". Is it convincible? \nWhat are the critical bioactive compounds in Chachi? To answer these questions, \ngas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultrahigh performance liquid \nchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were used to qualify and \nquantify the flavonoid glycosides and other bioactive compounds of Chachi with \nstorage time of 5-20 years. Limonene was the representative volatile compound. \nThe level of most volatile compounds decreased along with storage. Sixteen \nflavonoids glycosides and twenty flavonoids were identified. Nobiletin, \nhesperitin, tetramethoxy flavone and pentamethoxy flavone were characteristic \nbioactive compounds for Chachi. Most of them accumulated during 10-year storage, \nthereafter decreased. Ten years could be the optimal storage time. These results \nindicated that the old saying should be corrected.", "output": ""},
{"input": "Citrus pectin is known to influence carotenoid bioaccessibility and absorption \nin humans, but limited attention has been given to the influence of pectin \nstructure related to the particle size from differentially processed citrus food \nmatrices. In this context, this study aims to investigate the nutritional health \nbenefits of an innovative Citrus clementina concentrate, which is a new \ncitrus-based food made by cross-flow microfiltration. This concentrated \ncitrus-based food was selectively enriched 8-fold in \u03b2-cryptoxanthin (43-55 \u03bcg \ng-1) and \u03b2-carotene (6-9 \u03bcg g-1) as well as 6-fold in pectin (376-462 mg per 100 \ng). The bioaccessibility of pro-vitamin A carotenoids from commercial and fresh \nclementina juices versus their concentrates was assessed, including the \nintestinal carotenoid uptake by Caco-2 cells. Differences in particles size and \npectin status resulted in a 7-fold increase in the bioaccessibility of \ncarotenoids in industrial products versus fresh products while limiting their \ncellular uptake in correlation with larger micelle sizes (10.6 nm and 6.82 nm \nfor industrial and fresh concentrates, respectively). Overall, the highest \ncarotenoid bioaccessibility from industrial concentrate was sufficient to offset \nthe lower carotenoid intestinal uptake related to micelle size. This study \nhighlights that the structure of pectins, more specifically their degree of \nmethoxylation, favors carotenoid bioaccessibility but impairs the intestinal \nabsorption of carotenoids from citrus concentrates.", "output": ""},
{"input": "Red-fleshed oranges (Citrus sinensis) contain high levels of carotenoids and \nlycopene. The growing consumer demand for products with health benefits has \nincreased interest in these types of Citrus cultivars as a potential source of \nnutraceuticals. However, little is known about the physiology of these cultivars \nunder Brazilian conditions. Transcriptome and gene expression analyses are \nimportant tools in the breeding and management of red-fleshed sweet orange \ncultivars. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction is a \nmethod of quantifying gene expression, but various standardizations are required \nto obtain precise, accurate, and specific results. Among the standardizations \nrequired, the choice of suitable stable reference genes is fundamental. The \nobjective of this study was to evaluate the stability of 11 candidate genes \nusing various tissue and organ samples from healthy plants or leaves from citrus \ngreening disease (Huanglongbing)-symptomatic plants of a Brazilian red-fleshed \ncultivar ('Sangu\u00ednea de Mombuca'), in order to select the most suitable \nreference gene for investigating gene expression under these conditions. geNorm \nand NormFinder identified genes that encoded translation initiation factor 3, \nribosomal protein L35, and translation initiation factor 5A as the most stable \ngenes under the biological conditions tested, and genes coding actin (ACT) and \nthe subunit of the PSI reaction center subunit III were the least stable. \nPhosphatase, malate dehydrogenase, and ACT were the most stable genes in the \nleaf samples of infected plants.", "output": ""},
{"input": "In an earlier study, an electronic tongue system (e-tongue) has been used to \ndifferentiate between orange juice made from healthy fruit and from fruit \naffected by the citrus greening or Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. This study \ninvestigated the reaction of an e-tongue system to the main chemicals in orange \njuice that impact flavor and health benefits and are also impacted by HLB. \nOrange juice was spiked with sucrose (0.2-5.0 g/100 mL), citric acid (0.1%-3.0% \ng/100 mL) and potassium chloride (0.1-3.0 g/100 mL) as well as the secondary \nmetabolites nomilin (1-30 \u00b5g/mL), limonin (1-30 \u00b5g/mL), limonin glucoside \n(30-200 \u00b5g/mL), hesperidin (30-400 \u00b5g/mL) and hesperetin (30-400 \u00b5g/mL). \nPerformance of Alpha MOS sensor sets #1 (pharmaceutical) and #5 (food) were \ncompared for the same samples, with sensor set #1 generally giving better \nseparation than sensor set #5 for sucrose, sensor set #5 giving better \nseparation for nomilin and limonin, both sets being efficient at separating \ncitric acid, potassium chloride, hesperitin and limonin glucoside, and neither \nset discriminating hesperidin efficiently. Orange juice made from fruit over the \nharvest season and from fruit harvested from healthy or HLB-affected trees were \nseparated by harvest maturity, disease state and disease severity.", "output": ""},
{"input": "Citrus flavonoids are natural compounds with important health benefits. The \nstudy of their interaction with a transport protein, such as bovine \n\u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG), at the atomic level could be a valuable factor to control \ntheir transport to biological sites. In the present study, molecular docking and \nmolecular dynamics simulation methods were used to investigate the interaction \nof hesperetin, naringenin, nobiletin and tangeretin as citrus flavonoids and BLG \nas transport protein. The molecular docking results revealed that these \nflavonoids bind in the internal cavity of BLG and the BLG affinity for binding \nthe flavonoids follows naringenin>hesperetin>tangeretin>nobiletin. The docking \nresults also indicated that the BLG-flavonoid complexes are stabilized through \nhydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond interactions and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking \ninteractions. The analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories \nshowed that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of various systems reaches \nequilibrium and fluctuates around the mean value at various times. Time \nevolution of the radius of gyration, total solvent accessible surface of the \nprotein and the second structure of protein showed as well that BLG and \nBLG-flavonoid complexes were stable around 2500ps, and there was not any \nconformational change as for BLG-flavonoid complexes. Further, the profiles of \natomic fluctuations indicated the rigidity of the ligand binding site during the \nsimulation.", "output": ""}]
